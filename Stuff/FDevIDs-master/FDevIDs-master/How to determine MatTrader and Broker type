How to determine material trader and technology broker type by the station economies in simple pseudocode:

Material trader type:
IF (primary_economy == "hightech" OR primary_economy == "military") trader_type = "Encoded";
IF (primary_economy == "extraction" OR primary_economy == "refinery") trader_type = "Raw material";
IF (primary_economy == "industrial") trader_type = "Manufactured";
IF (secondary_economy == "hightech" OR secondary_economy == "military") trader_type = "Encoded";
IF (secondary_economy == "extraction" OR secondary_economy == "refinery") trader_type = "Raw material";
IF (secondary_economy == "industrial") trader_type = "Manufactured";

Tech broker type:
IF (primary_economy == "hightech") broker_type = "Guardian";
IF (primary_economy == "industrial") broker_type = "Human"; // human may be set as a default and it is not needed
IF (secondary_economy == "hightech") broker_type = "Guardian";
IF (secondary_economy != null AND secondary_economy != "hightech") broker_type = "Human"; // needs a confirmation
